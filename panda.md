"Little Panda Qiqi's Bedtime Routine" — An Interactive Storybook App for Children's Habit Formation

Design Documentation

By Wang Nan

# Concept Paper

## Introduction

This project aims to design and prototype an interactive storybook application titled "Little Panda Qiqi's Bedtime Routine." The app primarily targets toddlers aged 2 to 4 and their parents. It addresses the common challenges of resistance and procrastination during bedtime preparations by transforming mundane routines into an engaging adventure through an immersive story experience.

The inspiration for this project stems from a universal parenting reality: establishing a consistent bedtime routine is crucial for a child's development, yet the process is often fraught with challenges and parental stress. While numerous storybook apps exist in the market, there remains significant potential for products that deeply integrate specific life skill cultivation with a coherent narrative.

The core design philosophy of this application is "Guiding Habits through Interaction." The user (the child) will act as a companion to the little panda, Qiqi. Across four core scenes, through simple touch interactions like tapping and dragging, the user will help Qiqi complete tasks such as "Putting Toys Away," "Bubble Brushing," "Cozy Bath Time," and "Goodnight Story." Each successful interaction advances the storyline and provides the user with positive visual and auditory feedback, thereby subtly guiding children to imitate and learn correct bedtime behaviors through a sense of achievement.

This project will adhere to user-centered design principles. Starting from defining the target users and their needs, it will utilize storyboards, wireframes, and a paper prototype to fully present the user journey and interface of this application, laying a solid foundation for developing a children's product that is truly educational, entertaining, and alleviates parental anxiety.

## Description

Tonight, you get to help Little Panda Qiqi get ready for bed! When you open "Little Panda Qiqi's Bedtime Routine," you are first greeted by soft music and a view of Qiqi under a starry night sky, rubbing his eyes and feeling sleepy. On the home screen, you see a sparkling "Start the Adventure!" button. Tapping on it begins our story!

First Stop: The Toy Garden. You see that Qiqi's room is messy, with toys scattered all over the floor. A toy chest is bouncing nearby. You need to gently drag each toy into the chest. When you place the last toy inside, the lid will snap shut with a satisfying sound. Qiqi will clap his hands joyfully, and all the toys inside will glow softly, as if whispering goodnight to you.

Second Stop: The Brushing Pro. Next, you and Qiqi head to the bathroom. In the mirror, Qiqi is holding his toothbrush, waiting for you. There's a tube of toothpaste on the counter. Tapping on the tube will squeeze a perfect amount of paste onto Qiqi's brush. Then, you need to swipe your finger gently back and forth across the screen to help Qiqi brush his teeth. As you swipe, the brush will move, creating lots of foamy bubbles, and Qiqi's teeth will become sparkling clean!

Third Stop: The Warm Bubble Bath. After brushing, it's time for a cozy bath. The tub is filled with water, but it needs bubbles! A bottle of bubble bath is sitting nearby. Tapping the bottle will release a joyful "poof" of colorful bubbles that fill the entire tub! You can also tap on the little rubber duck floating in the water, and it will respond with a cheerful "quack," making bath time even more fun for Qiqi.

Fourth Stop: The Goodnight Story. All clean and in his pajamas, Qiqi snuggles into bed, ready for a bedtime story. Three different storybooks are on the shelf. Tapping on one of them will make it fly down and open its pages automatically. You can swipe from left to right to turn the pages and enjoy the beautiful illustrations inside. When the story ends, Qiqi will let out a big, happy yawn and close his eyes contentedly.

Finally, you will arrive at the credits page, where the Moon Granny and twinkling stars will say to you, "You were wonderful! You helped Qiqi complete all his tasks. Now it's your turn to sleep tight, just like Qiqi. Goodnight!"

## Key Features

Contextual Task-Based Interactions: Real-life bedtime routine steps (e.g., tidying toys, brushing teeth) are seamlessly integrated into the story narrative. Children directly participate in and drive the story forward through intuitive gestures like dragging and swiping, transforming "parental instructions" into the "need to help a friend," thereby fostering intrinsic motivation.

Positive Behavior Guidance & Instant Feedback System: Every correct interaction triggers positive visual and auditory feedback (e.g., cheerful animations, encouraging sound effects, and character praise). This instant sense of achievement reinforces the child's correct behavior, subtly guiding and transferring these habits to real-life situations.

Explorable Soothing Mini-Games: Beyond the core routine, the app incorporates moments of relaxed exploration (e.g., tapping a rubber duck in the bath to hear a quack). These low-pressure, high-delight interactive elements not only enhance replay value but also help soothe a child's pre-sleep mood, creating a calm and pleasant bedtime atmosphere.

## Theme / Concept Art

The overall visual theme of this project is defined as "Cozy, Dreamy, and Cute," aiming to create a safe, comfortable, and imaginative pre-sleep world for young children. The visual design will adopt a soft, hand-drawn style, avoiding sharp lines and high-contrast colors to protect children's eyesight and soothe their mood.

### Visual Style References:

Color Palette: The primary color scheme will utilize nighttime shades of deep blue, purple, and warm yellow to create a tranquil bedtime atmosphere. Characters and interactive elements will employ bright yet non-stimulating candy colors (e.g., Qiqi's reddish-brown, the light pink of bubbles, the light blue of water) to ensure visibility against darker backgrounds and evoke a sense of delight.

Character Design Concept: The design of the protagonist, Little Panda Qiqi, will emphasize "roundness, softness, and friendliness." He will feature a large head, big round eyes, and soft body curves. His expressions will be rich and slightly exaggerated to convey clear emotions (e.g., sleepiness, happiness, surprise), making it easy for young children to understand and empathize.

Scene & UI Concept: Scene designs will incorporate dreamlike elements, such as starry backgrounds, glowing toys, and soft cloud-like edges. User Interface (UI) elements, like buttons and icons, will be designed with rounded corners and integrated into natural objects (e.g., cloud-shaped buttons, star icons), making them part of the scene rather than stark overlays.
