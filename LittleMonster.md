"The Little Monster's Emotion Maze" — An Interactive Storybook App Guiding Children's Emotional Management

Design Documentation

# Concept Paper

## Introduction

This project aims to design and prototype an interactive storybook application titled "The Little Monster's Emotion Maze." The app primarily targets children aged 5 to 8, guiding them to learn how to identify, understand, and manage their core emotions—such as anger, sadness, fear, and overwhelming excitement—through a highly metaphorical and engaging narrative framework.

The conception of this project stems from an focus on contemporary children's mental health. During this developmental stage, children begin to experience increasingly complex emotions but often lack an effective "emotional vocabulary" and regulatory tools, making them prone to behavioral issues or internal stress due to emotional fluctuations. While numerous cognitive educational apps exist in the market, products that skillfully translate core social-emotional learning skills into immersive, gamified interactive experiences remain at the forefront of exploration.

This application draws inspiration from the psychological concept of "externalizing emotions" in narrative therapy and methods for managing emotions through mindfulness practices. Its core design philosophy is "Materializing internal, abstract emotional experiences into an explorable and interactive maze world." The user will act as a kind "Emotion Helper," entering the little monster's inner maze and completing a series of evidence-based emotional regulation activities (such as guided breathing, positive cognitive reframing, and sensory soothing) to help the little monster calm down.

By following a user-centered design process, this project is committed to creating a safe and compassionate virtual space where children can subtly acquire essential emotional management skills for life through the journey of helping the little monster.

## Description

### Target User Demographics

This project primarily targets children aged 5 to 8. Children in this age group are at a critical stage of emotional development. They experience and can identify complex emotions but often struggle to articulate them verbally and lack effective self-regulation strategies. The secondary users are their parents and educators, who seek tools to support children's emotional literacy and help them navigate daily emotional challenges.

### User Experience Description

Welcome to Emotion Town! Here lives a fluffy little monster named Moro. Moro is very friendly, but sometimes strong feelings become overwhelming. Today, when you open "The Little Monster's Emotion Maze," you find Moro bright red with anger—it looks like a volcano is erupting inside him! But don't worry, you can help.

You gently touch the red aura surrounding Moro, and instantly, you are pulled into the Anger Maze. It's like a fiery lava cave inside! The paths are blocked by steaming hot rocks, and little sparks of rage flicker in the air. You notice cool, blue air currents at the edges of the screen. You need to slowly trace circles with your finger to guide this air into the maze. As you do, a gentle breeze blows out the sparks and cools the rocks. At the maze's heart, a giant "Core of Anger" is throbbing violently. You place your hand flat over the screen and hold it still for a count of three. As you take a deep, calm breath with Moro, the core slowly calms down, eventually shattering with a soft chime into a rainbow bridge leading out. When you leave, all the red has faded from Moro, and he gives you a giant, grateful hug.

The next day, you find Moro curled up in a corner, shaded in melancholy blue. You enter the Sadness Maze, where everything is washed out and colourless, with a constant drizzle. You need to gently tap the grey trees, clouds, and flowers. Each touch restores their vibrant colour and makes the rain stop. When you've brightened the whole maze, sunlight breaks through the clouds, and Moro's sadness lifts.

Later, you will explore the shadowy Fear Maze, dragging a lantern to illuminate every dark corner, discovering that the scary shadows are just friendly shapes. You will also step into the overly loud Joy Maze, tapping rhythmically on glowing orbs to turn chaotic revelry into a harmonious symphony.

Every time you successfully emerge from a maze, Moro learns a new emotion magic, and you become his most trusted Emotion Hero!

## Key Features

The core features of this interactive storybook are designed to translate the abstract process of emotional management into tangible, actionable experiences for children through carefully crafted metaphorical interactions. Its key features include:

Metaphorical Emotion Maze Exploration: Four core emotions (Anger, Sadness, Fear, Overwhelming Joy) are materialized into four unique, explorable maze worlds. Each maze features distinct visual styles, music, and interactive mechanics (e.g., cooling the "Anger Maze," coloring the "Sadness Maze"), allowing children to intuitively understand the "inner landscape" and transformation methods of different emotions through the process of helping the little monster.

Evidence-Based Emotional Regulation Interactions: Every interactive challenge within the mazes is grounded in emotional regulation strategies from child psychology. Through gamified actions like guided breathing (long press to calm the core), positive reframing (tapping to recolor), sensory soothing (guiding breezes), and mindfulness (lighting up darkness), children unconsciously practice and master effective techniques for calming strong emotions.

Safe "Proxy Learning" Narrative: An innovative "helper" perspective design. The user does not directly manage their own emotions but acts as an "Emotion Hero" helping the little monster, Moro. This indirect "proxy learning" approach creates a safe psychological distance, significantly reducing a child's defensiveness and allowing them to learn and internalize emotional management skills more openly and empathetically.

Progressive & Non-Linear Experience: The app does not enforce a fixed sequence, allowing the child to freely choose which maze to enter based on the emotion Moro is exhibiting that day. This design respects the authenticity and uniqueness of a child's emotional world, encourages repeated use to address different emotional challenges at different times, and thereby reinforces the learning outcomes.

## Theme / Concept Art

The overall visual theme of this project is defined as "Expressive Soft Fantasy," aiming to create an inner world that feels both safe and intriguing for exploration, helping children confront strong emotions. The visual design will employ a hand-drawn texture, expressive color use, and soft outlines, avoiding realistic or frightening styles to ensure the environment is child-friendly.

### Visual Style References

Color Palette: Color is the primary tool for expressing emotion.

Primary/Neutral Colors: Soft clay, cream, and light grey tones provide a stable, warm base for the "real world" outside the mazes (e.g., Emotion Town).

Emotional Colors:

Anger: Fiery reds, oranges, and yellows.

Sadness: Muted blues, cool grays, and lavender.

Fear: Deep indigos, shadows, and limited pools of spotlight.

Joy: Over-saturated rainbow colors, shining gold, and electric pink.

Character Design Concept: The design of the protagonist, Moro the little monster, will emphasize "softness, mutability, and expressiveness." His body features rounded lines and a soft, fuzzy texture. His key characteristic is that his color and slight form change with his emotions (e.g., turning red and slightly inflating when angry; shrinking and turning blue when sad). His eyes are large and expressive, capable of conveying a full spectrum of feelings from distress to calm.

Scene & UI Concept: The mazes themselves will be abstract and symbolic rather than architectural. User Interface (UI) elements, like buttons and indicators, will be designed as organic shapes (e.g., smooth stones, soft clouds) with subtle pulsing animations, making them feel like living parts of the maze world. Interactive feedback (e.g., guiding airflow) will be presented through soft glow and particle effects.
